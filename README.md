# DjangoProjectStarter
This script automates the task of making a DjangoProject.A Django project involves a variety of processes like applying migrations, creating static files, adding templates, creating different directories, updating urls and importing important modules, so I made this script to automate this task.


## Usage
This script can be executed in two ways:

### 1.Using arguments
    You can use arguments to specif different variables in this script.For example:
    ```python
    
    
    
    i=0
    while i<100:
        print(i)
        
        
    ```
